          For the Martial Arts Gyms that still uses a paper based information tracking system, The Martial Arts Gym Information Tracking System is an automated solution that is reliable, consistent and faster unlike a traditional paper-based information system. It will accurately track session and attendance. It will also store other useful data such as session schedules, instructor’s information, and client’s information in a cloud database resulting in a much secure data storage and improved workflow.

        <p>Business Opportunity <br>
        There are a couple of business opportunities that have been identified. 
        First, small gyms such as Martial Arts Gyms (MAGs) usually does not keep copies of digital records of its instructors, students and classes offered to students. The digital records include user profiles, membership types and other personal information. Second, the MAGs does not currently have a way to track a student’s attendance, especially those with membership types that are Limited. Third, there is currently no platform for instructors to communicate to the students any kind of announcements such as cancellation of classes, etc.

        <h3>Objectives</h3>
        <p>To create a web application that automates business processes and solves common problems that small Martial Arts Gyms face in their everyday operations. The project will enable the gym to keep digital records of students’ profiles, monitor the remaining sessions on their account, track their attendance and use modern scanning technologies such as a QR code to submit attendance.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Corporate Goals Addressed</h3>
        <p>Have an efficient system to handle core business processes.
          Convert physical files to be stored in digital storage
        </p>

        <ul class="fa-ul mb-0">
          <li>The system is for small businesses, which is defined as privately owned corporations, partnerships, or sole proprietorships that have fewer employees and/or less annual revenue than a regular-sized business or corporation.</li>

          <li>The MAG staff are computer literate.</li>
          <li>The gym member always carries a device or a card that has their QR code for the session check-in.</li>

        <h2>Dependencies</h2>
        <p>The following are the internal and external dependencies that will have to be acknowledged and addressed;</p>
        <ul class="fa-ul mb-0">
          <li>The user must be registered to be able to see the courses in the system.</li>

          <li>The member should pay the membership before they are enrolled in a course by the instructor.</li>
          <li></li>
          <li>The user must be enrolled in a course to be able to have a qr code where their course session will be scanned and thus having their attendance tracked.</li>

        <p>The following are some of what the team has analyzed. 
          The team started with getting the user's use cases. Building from that knowledge the team formed the UML Diagram, logical diagram, data model and data flow diagram.
          These diagram will help to determine the relationships between the entities and data flow of the whole application.</p>
        <p>Some of the following use cases are on the high level side such as for the Instructor and Admin.
